## HBT-HERONS

HBT-HERONS (**H**ierarchical **B**ound **T**racing - **H**ydro-**E**nabled **R**etrieval of **O**bjects in **N**umerical **S**imulations) is a new version of the HBT+ history-based subhalo finder. This new version includes new additions to the code:

 - Compatibility with [SWIFT](https://swift.strw.leidenuniv.nl/) outputs.
 - Improved tracking of subhaloes in hydrodynamical and dark matter-only simulations.
 - Better domain decomposition, which was required to run on the large-scale [FLAMINGO](https://flamingo.strw.leidenuniv.nl/) simulations.

Documentation on how to compile, run and analyse the outputs of HBT-HERONS is available on the [official documentation page](https://hbt-herons.strw.leidenuniv.nl/).
