# Format

The outputs of **HBT-HERONS** are saved using the HDF5 file format.

!!! tip
    
    If you are analysing a simulation with many subhaloes and time outputs, we strongly
    recommend using the [`toolbox/SortCatalogues.py`](https://github.com/SWIFTSIM/HBT-HERONS/blob/master/toolbox/SortCatalogues.py) script. This script merges all files generated by different MPI ranks into a single one, and sorts subhaloes (and
    their properties) according to their `TrackId`. Doing the sorting helps speed up subsequent file reads since the index
    location of a subhalo is known beforehand.
